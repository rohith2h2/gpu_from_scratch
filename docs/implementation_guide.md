# Tiny GPU Implementation Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide to understanding and implementing a minimal GPU in SystemVerilog. Follow these steps to build your own GPU from scratch.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Project Setup and Planning

- **Create Project Structure**: Set up directories for source files, tests, documentation, etc.
- **Define Interfaces**: Plan how modules will communicate with each other
- **Set Project Goals**: Define what features the GPU will support

### 2. Implement Basic Modules

#### GPU Package

The `gpu_pkg.sv` file defines common types, constants, and parameters that will be used throughout the project, including:

- **Core States**: Defines the states of the execution pipeline (FETCH, DECODE, etc.)
- **LSU States**: Defines states for the memory access operations
- **ALU Operations**: Defines arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB, etc.)
- **Instruction Format**: Defines how instructions are encoded
- **Opcode Definitions**: Maps opcodes to instruction types
- **Register Definitions**: Defines special register addresses

**Key Concept**: Using a central package ensures consistency across the entire design and makes changes easier to implement.

#### ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

The ALU performs arithmetic and logical operations for each thread:

- **Arithmetic Operations**: Implements ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV operations
- **Comparison Operations**: Sets NZP (negative, zero, positive) flags for branch conditions

**Key Concept**: The ALU operates on the data from registers in the EXECUTE stage of the pipeline. Each thread has its own ALU instance allowing for parallel execution of the same instruction on different data (SIMD).

#### PC (Program Counter)

The PC manages program execution flow for each thread:

- **Next PC Calculation**: Determines the next instruction to execute
- **Branch Handling**: Handles conditional branches based on NZP flags
- **NZP Register**: Stores comparison results for branch decisions

**Key Concept**: Although each thread has its own PC, all threads in a block are assumed to converge to the same PC after each instruction for simplicity (no branch divergence handling).

#### LSU (Load-Store Unit)

The LSU handles memory operations for each thread:

- **Memory Read**: Loads data from global memory
- **Memory Write**: Stores data to global memory
- **Asynchronous Operation**: Manages wait states for memory operations

**Key Concept**: Memory operations are asynchronous and may take multiple cycles to complete. The LSU handles this by implementing a state machine that tracks memory request status.

#### Register File

The register file stores data for each thread:

- **General Purpose Registers**: R0-R12 for user data
- **Special Registers**: R13-R15 contain block ID, block dimensions, and thread ID
- **Register Read/Write**: Manages access to register data

**Key Concept**: The register file provides separate data to each thread, allowing the SIMD paradigm to work. Special registers help threads identify themselves and access unique data.

### 3. Implement Higher-Level Modules

#### Instruction Fetcher

The fetcher retrieves instructions from program memory:

- **Instruction Request**: Requests instruction at current PC
- **Asynchronous Access**: Handles wait states for memory access
- **Instruction Buffering**: Provides instruction to decoder

**Key Concept**: Instruction fetching is the first stage of the pipeline and must handle memory latency appropriately.

#### Instruction Decoder

The decoder converts raw instructions into control signals:

- **Instruction Parsing**: Extracts opcode, register addresses, and immediate values
- **Control Signal Generation**: Sets signals for other modules based on instruction type

**Key Concept**: The decoder translates the instruction into specific control signals that direct the operation of all other modules during execution.

#### Scheduler

The scheduler manages the execution pipeline for a core:

- **Pipeline State Management**: Controls progression through pipeline stages
- **Memory Wait Handling**: Ensures all LSUs complete before moving to next stage
- **Thread Synchronization**: Ensures all threads complete current instruction

**Key Concept**: The scheduler is responsible for the orderly progression of instructions through the execution pipeline, handling synchronization points.

#### Memory Controller

The memory controller manages access to external memory:

- **Request Arbitration**: Decides which memory requests to service when
- **Request Queuing**: Buffers requests when memory is busy
- **Response Routing**: Routes responses back to requesting module

**Key Concept**: Since memory bandwidth is limited, the controller must efficiently arbitrate between multiple competing requests from different cores and threads.

#### Device Control Register (DCR)

The DCR stores kernel execution parameters:

- **Thread Count**: Stores the total number of threads to launch
- **Control Interface**: Allows the host to configure kernel execution

**Key Concept**: The DCR is the interface between the host system and the GPU, allowing configuration of kernel execution.

#### Dispatcher

The dispatcher distributes work to cores:

- **Block Distribution**: Assigns blocks to available cores
- **Thread Count Management**: Determines how many threads each block needs
- **Core Synchronization**: Tracks when cores complete blocks

**Key Concept**: The dispatcher implements the grid/block execution model typical of GPU programming, distributing work across multiple cores.

### 4. Integration

#### Core Module

The core module integrates thread components and manages execution:

- **Thread Resources**: Instantiates resources (ALU, LSU, registers) for each thread
- **Control Flow**: Connects scheduler, fetcher, and decoder
- **Memory Interface**: Manages interface to memory controllers

**Key Concept**: The core is the primary computational unit, managing a group of threads executing in lock-step (SIMD).

#### GPU Module

The top-level GPU module connects all components:

- **Core Instantiation**: Creates multiple compute cores
- **Memory Controller Integration**: Connects cores to memory
- **Dispatcher Connection**: Links dispatcher to cores
- **External Interface**: Provides interface to host system

**Key Concept**: The GPU module represents the complete accelerator, managing multiple cores and providing an interface to the external system.

### 5. Testing and Simulation

#### Memory Model

The memory model simulates external memory for testing:

- **Read/Write Interface**: Provides realistic memory access behavior
- **Latency Simulation**: Adds configurable latency to memory operations
- **Storage**: Stores program and data for simulation

**Key Concept**: The memory model enables realistic testing without actual hardware memory.

#### Test Bench

The test bench validates GPU functionality:

- **Clock Generation**: Provides clock signal for simulation
- **Test Sequence**: Configures GPU and starts kernel execution
- **Result Verification**: Checks the computed results

**Key Concept**: The test bench provides a controlled environment to validate GPU functionality.

## Key GPU Concepts

### SIMD (Same Instruction Multiple Data)

- **What It Is**: SIMD is a parallel execution model where multiple processing elements perform the same operation on different data elements simultaneously.
- **How It's Implemented**: Each thread has its own data (in registers) but executes the same instruction.
- **Why It Matters**: SIMD increases computational throughput for data-parallel tasks like matrix operations.

### Thread Execution Model

- **What It Is**: The organization of parallel execution into threads and blocks.
- **How It's Implemented**: Threads are grouped into blocks; each block runs on one core; blocks are distributed across cores.
- **Why It Matters**: This model allows for efficient scaling across different hardware configurations.

### Memory Hierarchy

- **What It Is**: The organization of memory into different levels with different access characteristics.
- **How It's Implemented**: Separate program and data memory with memory controllers managing access.
- **Why It Matters**: Memory bandwidth is often the bottleneck in GPU performance, so efficient memory access is critical.

### Pipeline Execution

- **What It Is**: Breaking instruction execution into discrete stages that can be executed in sequence.
- **How It's Implemented**: Instructions flow through stages: FETCH, DECODE, REQUEST, WAIT, EXECUTE, UPDATE.
- **Why It Matters**: Pipelining allows for better resource utilization and throughput.

## Advanced Concepts for Future Exploration

### Memory Coalescing

Implementing memory coalescing would involve:
- Adding a module to detect and combine adjacent memory accesses
- Modifying the memory controller to handle coalesced requests
- Distributing returned data to the appropriate threads

### Warp Scheduling

Adding warp scheduling would require:
- Dividing threads into warps (subgroups)
- Implementing a scheduling algorithm to switch between warps
- Adding state tracking for each warp
